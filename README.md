# SpaceInvaders
Space Invaders 2d game in Java created for learning purposes.
My objective is to learn fundamentals of game design as well as Java Core Api and OOP.

To move your spaceship either move your mouse left/right to your craft, or press strafe left/right or A/D.
To shoot invaders either press mouse or spacebar.

It is still in progress.
